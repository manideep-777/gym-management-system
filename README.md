- **Member Management**: Add, update, delete, and search gym members.
- **Billing System**: Generate and manage payment receipts and notifications.
- **Fee Package Assignment**: Assign different fee structures to members.
- **Reports & Analytics**: Generate reports on membership, payments, and attendance.
- **Notifications**: Send reminders for membership renewals and fee payments.
- **Supplement Store (Future Scope)**: Integrate a store for fitness supplements.
- **Diet & Workout Plans**: Assign customized diet and exercise plans.

### Member Panel:
- **Dashboard**: View profile, membership status, and notifications.
- **View Bills & Receipts**: Access digital copies of all payments.
- **Workout & Diet Plan Access**: View assigned workout and nutrition plans.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Monitor check-ins and workout sessions.
